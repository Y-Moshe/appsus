And that’s why you should never compare yourself to anyone else.\n The most powerful thing you can do as a drummer is harness your own identity. \n It’s good to pull inspiration from others, but your ultimate goal should be to find your own voice on the kit. \n That’s what all the practicing, studying, and listening is for.\n Drumeo’s goal has always been to help more people find their voice on the drums – and there’s something HUGE coming at the end of the month to make that easier than ever.\n Stay tuned.\n To Your Drumming Success,\n- Jared Falk",

And that’s why you should never compare yourself to anyone else.\n The most powerful thing you can do as a drummer is harness your own identity. \n It’s good to pull inspiration from others, but your ultimate goal should be to find your own voice on the kit. \n That’s what all the practicing, studying, and listening is for.\n Drumeo’s goal has always been to help more people find their voice on the drums – and there’s something HUGE coming at the end of the month to make that easier than ever.\n Stay tuned.\n To Your Drumming Success,\n- Jared Falk",

And that’s why you should never compare yourself to anyone else.\n The most powerful thing you can do as a drummer is harness your own identity. \n It’s good to pull inspiration from others, but your ultimate goal should be to find your own voice on the kit. \n That’s what all the practicing, studying, and listening is for.\n Drumeo’s goal has always been to help more people find their voice on the drums – and there’s something HUGE coming at the end of the month to make that easier than ever.\n Stay tuned.\n To Your Drumming Success,\n- Jared Falk",
